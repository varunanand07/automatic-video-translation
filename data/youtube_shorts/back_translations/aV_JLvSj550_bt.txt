I'm at Katz's shop, I like 2:00 in the morning.. First of all, they serve you pastrami samples.. How good can it be?. Hey.. Hey, I'm gonna get one.. I'm gonna get one.. I want one.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. I want one too.. Oh, my God.. This is really one of the best pastrami you can get.. They're cheese in the crowd, great addition.. The Russian dress complements this really well. Give some sweetness. The only thing is bread.. It's the biggest piece of dog shit.. But if you have a couple of drinks, of course I have to go fight our meeting.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah.. That's amazing.. Keep in mind I've had a lot to drink tonight.. I'd give this a 8.8 out of 10.. I'm not gonna be happy.
