Three mistakes, that's making money M. Do not make the mistake of exchanging your money at these places of money exchange. I just got ripped off.. You honestly don't need cash in London, not even for street markets, but if you really need some money, go to the post office and swap.. Number two, every place I've spoken to in London has had their phones stolen at least once.. It got out of hand, I bought a phone trap and a next trap and I could shoot this little video, but I was still very careful.. And number one, it's so easy to take public transport.. Sometimes it's even faster than a car and you can use your Apple wallet.
