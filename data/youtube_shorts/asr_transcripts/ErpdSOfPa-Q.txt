 Three mistakes, that's make M money. Do not make the mistake of exchanging your money at these money exchanging places. I just got ripped off. You honestly don't need cash in London, not even for the street markets, but if you really need some cash, go to the post office and exchange. Number two, every single local that I have talked to in London has had their phones stolen at least once. It has gotten so out of hand, I bought a phone trap and a next trap and I was able to record this little video is but I was still very careful. And number one, it's so easy to take public transportation. Sometimes it's even faster than a car and you can use your Apple wallet.
