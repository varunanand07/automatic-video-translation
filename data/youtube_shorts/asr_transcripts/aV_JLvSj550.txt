 You guys asked for a drunk food review? I'm at Katz's deli, I like 2AM. First off, they serve you samples of pastrami. How good can it possibly get? I want it. Hey. Hey, I'm getting one. I'm getting one. I want one. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. I want one too. Oh my god. This is seriously some of the best pastrami you can ever get. They're cheese in the crowd, great addition. The Russian dressing compliments this really well. It gives a little bit of sweetness. The only thing is the bread. It's the biggest piece of dog shit. But if you've got a couple drinks, of course I have to go to fight with our muster. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. Keep in mind, I've drank a lot tonight. I would give this an 8.8 out of 10. I'm not going to be happy.
