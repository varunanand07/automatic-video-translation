 Hey, speaking of sea gods, isn't it interesting that Aquaman has a... What are those things called a... Trident? A Trident. But it's got like six prongs on it. It doesn't have three? No, it's like a... It's like a... A sixthed. Yes, a sixthed. No, that's seven-bow. Six fish. It's a pentadant. No. It's having more fish to eat. Does he eat fish? No, he's not. No, he's not. He's a part of this one fish. No, he talks to... Hmm, shit. Yeah, but I don't think he's a predatory fish. I think he talks to... He's food. He's food. He's a little... A little flake on the top of the ocean. Yeah. So I'm just... Yeah. Yeah. You feed him the same way you'd feed a goldfish. I have not seen Aquaman. I don't think I will. It's great. But he likes that. Like Spider-Man. Yeah. It's good. I haven't seen much for some. Is it high school and he gets bit by his spider? No. Why an origin? Okay. Why are all the new Spider-Man movies about him being... You know, whatever distance he is from his home. Yeah. Homecoming far from home. Yeah. Far from home. Like, I can't get home. I'm not home now, but call me later. Eight legs and you can't make your way home? You should be able to get home eight times faster. Why does he go to have eight legs? Four times faster. He always has two. Well, yeah. No, I always thought it would be funny to do a movie about somebody that gets bit by radio active spider. Starts to get all the powers of a spider and it's all good. But then he never stops turning into a spider. I guess that's what the fly is. That's the fly. Well, but he never has any power. He never has any cool power. Yes, he does. What's this fucking crazy strong? Remember, he's just like, you crazy strong. And then he's like very viral and women find him attractive because he's half fly. And then he touched me down. He touched me down. I love you. I like it. I like the expression looking fly. I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then the real turn, the real turn happens when, and then he can like, then he can throw off on stuff. He can, he can, he can just things outside of his body. That's a cool power. Well, it was like acid. See, I, that's a power I would like. And just go up. What if I could just literally just throw up on my food? I could do that. No, no, but have it just have that then dissolve the food. So I don't have to chew it. And then I can just, you know, slurp it up. That'd be cool. If I can metabolize sugar the way Jeff Goldman's character can in the fly, that'd be pretty sweet, right? To be able to metabolize sugar that well. Go ahead. What are those? What are his other powers? That's it. And then it starts to then he goes, then it goes dark. When he turns into a fucking fly. And then he's begging, do you remember the end of that movie? So good. Where he holds the guy's got the shotgun. Yeah, I need. I don't even remember. Well, I just remember him like if it was his, who's the female, the love interest? Because the she wasn't a pro. She wasn't a pro. She didn't, right? Yeah. So it might be Gina Davis who at the end is like shooting a shotgun and then she puts it up and like she let lowers it. And he's like almost defeated and he picks up the shotgun and puts it to his head. Yeah. Like he wants to be killed. And then David Kronenberg was like, well, now we have to show it. Yeah. And then Kronenberg and that fly head just fucking explodes. He's got to think for exploding heads that David Kronenberg done. Why didn't they just get a big wall of like a sweet smelling sticky paper? Right. Right. And just stick a fly paper. It is some fly paper. Yeah, because does he have a mind? Because he has the mind of a man and the body of a fly or does his mind also start turning into the fly? Well, he has the mind of a man, but the desires of a fly. Is that what you're saying? So he can think like a man, but his desires off as is off in the case with a man. His desires take over and he can't control himself. So yes, he would go straight to that. So you're a mind in your desires are somehow disconnected. When I'm saying mine are I'm saying all men are. As as our flop. And that's a fact. That's a fact. Cut that.
