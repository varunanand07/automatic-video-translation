Speaking of sea gods, isn't it interesting that Aquaman has...?. What are those things called?. Trident?. But it's got, like, six tips.. - You don't have three?. It's like a.... A sixth. Yeah, a sixth.. No, that's seven-bow.. Six fish. It's a pentadant.. No. It's having more fish to eat.. - Do you eat fish?. No, it's not.. It's part of this fish.. No, he talks to... Hmm, shit.. Yeah, but I don't think it's a predatory fish.. I think he talks to... It's food.. It's food.. It's a little.... A little flake on top of the ocean. Yeah.. So I just.... Yeah.. Yeah.. You feed him the same way you feed a goldfish.. I haven't seen Aquaman.. I don't think he will.. It's great.. But he likes that.. Like Spider-Man.. Yeah.. It's good.. I haven't seen much for some.. Is it high school and it'll bite your spider?. Why an origin?. Why are all the new Spider-Man movies about him... You know, whatever distance he's from home.. Yeah.. Returning home away from home. Yeah.. Away from home. I can't get home.. I'm not home right now, but call me later.. Eight legs and you can't get home? You should be able to get home eight times faster.. Why are you going to have eight legs?. He always has two.. Well, yeah.. No, I always thought it would be fun to make a movie about someone being bitten by active spider radio.. He's starting to have all the powers of a spider and everything's fine.. But it never ceases to become a spider.. I guess that's what the fly is.. That's the fly.. Well, but it never has any power.. He never has any fresh power.. Yes, it does.. What's this fucking crazy fort?. And then he's very viral and women find him attractive because he's half a fly.. And then he touched me.. He touched me.. I love you.. I like it.. I like the expression that seems to fly. I think so.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Yeah.. And then the real spin, the real spin happens when, and then he can like, then he can pull out on things.. He can, he can, he can just stuff out of his body.. It's a great power.. Well, it was like acid.. Look, I, that's a power I'd like.. And go up.. What if I could literally throw up on my food?. No, no, but you have to dissolve the food.. So I don't have to chew it.. And then I can, you know, sip it.. That would be great.. If I can metabolize sugar the way Jeff Goldman's character can on the fly, that would be really sweet, wouldn't it?. Go ahead.. What are your other powers?. And then it starts to go, then it gets dark.. When he turns into a fucking fly. And then he's begging, remember the end of that movie?. Where the guy has the shotgun.. Yeah, I need to.. I don't even remember.. Well, I remember it as if it were yours, who is the woman, the interest in love?. She wasn't a professional.. He didn't, did he?. So it could be Gina Davis who in the end is like shooting a shotgun and then she puts it and how she let it down. And he's almost defeated and he grabs the shotgun and puts it on his head.. Yeah.. As if he wanted to be killed.. And then David Kronenberg was like, well, now we have to prove it.. Yeah.. And then Kronenberg and that flyhead explodes.. You have to think about blowing up heads that David Kronenberg made.. Why didn't you get a big sticky paper wall with a sweet smell?. Good.. And just stick a fly paper. It's a bit of fly paper.. Yes, because you have a mind? Because you have the mind of a man and the body of a fly or your mind also begins to become the fly? Well, you have the mind of a man, but the desires of a fly. Is that what you're saying? So I can think like a man, but his desires are turned off as in the case of a man.. His desires take hold and he can't control himself.. So yeah, I'd go straight to that.. So you're a mind in your desires somehow are disconnected.. When I say mine are, I say all men are.. Like our failure.. And that's a fact.. That's a fact.. Cut that.
