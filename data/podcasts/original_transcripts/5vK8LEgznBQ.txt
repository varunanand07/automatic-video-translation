hey speaking of speaking of uh sea gods um isn't it interesting that aquaman uh has a uh what are those things called a trident a trident but it's got like six prongs on it it doesn't have three no it's like a it's like a it's like a a sixth and a yes six seven seven no that's seven six fish it's a pentagon no he's stabbing more fish to eat does he eat fish is he he isn't no he's not he's knows eat fish no he talks to hmm yeah but i don't think he's a predatory fish i think he he talks that he can fish food those little flakes on the top of the ocean yeah yeah you feed you feed him the same way you'd feed a goldfish i have not seen aquaman i don't think i will it's great but he likes to like spiderman yeah like it's good i haven't seen is it the same story he's in high school and he gets bit by a spider no no it's not an origins okay why are all the new spider-man movies about him being you know whatever distance he is from from his home yeah homecoming far from home yeah um yeah far from home like i can't get home yeah i'm not home now but call me later eight legs and you can't make your way home you should be able to get home eight times fast when is he gonna have eight four times faster he always has two well yeah no i always thought it would be funny to to do a movie about somebody that gets bit by a radioactive spider starts to get all the powers of a spider and it's all good but then he never stops turning into a spider i guess that's what the flies were that's the fly well but he never has any he never has any cool powers he does what's his crazy strong remember he's just like oh crazy strong and then he's like very virile and women find him interactive because he's half fly for some reason and then he touched me is that what the expression looking fly came from i believe so yeah yeah right yeah yeah yeah and then and then the real turn the real turn happens when and then he can like well then he can throw up on stuff he can he can digest things outside of his body that's a cool power well it was like acid see i that's a power i would like and jeff goldblum what if i could just literally just throw up on my food oh you could do that no but have it just have that then dissolve the food so i don't have to chew it and then i can just you know slurp it up that'd be cool if i could metabolize sugar the way jeff goldblum's character can in the fly that'd be pretty sweet right to be able to metabolize sugar that well go ahead what are those what are those other powers that's different and then it starts to get dark then he goes then it goes dark when he turns into a flock and then he's begging do you remember the end of that movie so good where he holds the the guy's got the shotgun yeah i don't even remember barely i just remember him like if it was his who who's the um female who the love interest because the show is genius right yeah so it might be gina davis who at the end is like shooting the shotgun and then she puts it up and like she lowers it and he's like almost defeated and he picks up the shotgun and puts it to his head yeah like he wants to be killed and then david cronenberg was like well now we have to show it yeah because he's david cronenberg and that that fly head just explodes he's got a thing for exploding heads that dave and crow david cronenberg doesn't why didn't they just get a big wall of like a sweet smelling sticky paper right right and just stick it on supply paper it's some flat paper yeah yeah because because because he has the mind of a man and the body of a fly or does his mind also start turning into well he has the mind of a man but the desires of a fly does that make sense so he can think like a man but his desire is off as is often the case with a man his desires take over and he can't control himself so yes he would go straight to that mind and your desires are somehow disconnected when i'm saying mine are i'm saying all men are as as our flaws and that's a fact that's a fact cut that
